    "### Statement of the Problem\n",
    "We have data which are event counts binned into a spectrum in calorimetric energy. There is a spectrum generated by monte carlo and decomposed into neutral current event and charged current event components. There is also a data spectrum containing reconstructed events observed in the NOvA near detector. The spectra are created by applying a suite of cuts to files containing reconstructed event information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model therefore is the suite of cuts (each of which has one or several parameters, which we will collectively label $\\theta$), along with the proposition that the data and monte carlo spectra are in agreement. The data are the data and Monte Carlo event distributions (because the MC has no free parameters). Therefore, when we calculate $p(D|M,\\theta)$, we want to calculate the probability that the data and monte carlo spectra (surviving the model's cuts at $\\theta$ parameter values) are in agreement."

    "In addition, our model assumes that the data spectra have bin contents Poisson distributed with mean and variance given by the bin content of the total MC spectrum. This is well motivated because the data are the result of a Poisson process, and if the MC models the data well the mean in a given bin for the data will be the bin content for the MC. To a certain extent, this takes into account reconstruction efficiency, because the monte carlo are subjected to the same reconstruction pipeline as the data (of course, in MC we know whether the reconstruction was successful). Monte Carlo are normalized to the number of protons on target in the data file (that is, the flux of protons producing neutrinos during the time the data was taken, which means the MC and data should be seeing the same event rate)"
